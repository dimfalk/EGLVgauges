NRWgauges aims to grant easy access to gauge (meta-)data published on distributed web-based platforms by various water management associations in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

As of today, the following platforms can be harvested:

- pegel.eglv.de (Emschergenossenschaft / Lippeverband)

## Installation

You can install the development version of NRWgauges with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dimfalk/NRWgauges")
```

and load the package via

```{r}
library(NRWgauges)
```

## Basic example: EGLV

### Get gauge metadata, locations and latest measurements

```{r}
# fetch all available gauges
gauges <- get_eglv_gauges()
gauges

# ... eventually filter the dataset to the objects you're interested in
gauge <- gauges |> dplyr::filter(id == "10119")
gauge
```

### Get (extended) metadata for selected gauges

```{r}
get_eglv_meta(gauge)
```

### Get available measurements for selected gauges

```{r, warning = FALSE}
# fetch water level measurements
meas <- get_eglv_measurements(gauge)[[1]]
meas

class(meas)

plot(meas, main = "10119 Adenauerallee", ylab = "Water level [cm]")
```
